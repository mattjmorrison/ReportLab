Abstract = """This paper describes the primative methods underlying the implementation
of SQL query evaluation in Gadfly 2, a database management system implemented
in Python [Van Rossum]. The major design goals behind
the architecture described here are to simplify the implementation
and to permit flexible and efficient extensions to the gadfly
engine. Using this architecture and its interfaces programmers
can add functionality to the engine such as alternative disk based
indexed table implementations, dynamic interfaces to remote data
bases or or other data sources, and user defined computations."""

The relational model for database structures makes
the simplifying assumption that all data in a database
can be represented in simple table structures
such as these.  Although this assumption seems extreme
it provides a good foundation for defining solid and
well defined database management systems and some
of the most successful software companies in the
world, such as Oracle, Sybase, IBM, and Microsoft,
have marketed database management systems based on
the relational model quite successfully.

p("""
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
The SQL language defines industry standard
mechanisms for creating, querying, and modified
relational tables. Several years ago SQL was one
of many Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS) query languages in use, and many would
argue not the best on. Now, largely due
to standardization efforts and the
backing of IBM, SQL is THE standard way to talk
to database systems.

p("""
The chief advantage over all contenders at this time
is that SQL and the relational model are now widely
used as interfaces and back end data stores to many
different products with different performance characteristics,
user interfaces, and other qualities: Oracle, Sybase,
Ingres, SQL Server, Access, Outlook,
Excel, IBM DB2, Paradox, MySQL, MSQL, POSTgres, and many
others.  For this reason a program designed to use
an SQL database as its data storage mechanism can
easily be ported from one SQL data manager to another,
possibly on different platforms.  In fact the same
program can seamlessly use several backends and/or
import/export data between different data base platforms
with trivial ease.
No other paradigm offers such flexibility at the moment.

Another advantage which is not as immediately
obvious is that the relational model and the SQL

people and accountants.  Human resources managers

or a snippet of code that resembles a conventional
programming language will frequently feel quite at
ease with a relational model which resembles the
sort of tabular data they deal with on paper in

many other approaches cannot be understood easily
by people without extensive programming experience.

Furthermore the declarative nature of SQL

very easy to use (especially for programmers with previous experience
with SQL databases such as MS Access or Oracle), and reasonably
fast (especially when the kjbuckets C accellerators are used).
For moderate sized problems Gadfly offers a fairly complete
set of features such as transaction semantics, failure recovery,
and a TCP/IP based client/server mode (Please see [Gadfly] for
detailed discussion).""")


header("Why Gadfly 2?")

p("""Gadfly 1.0 also has significant limitations. An active Gadfly
1.0 database keeps all data in (virtual) memory, and hence a Gadfly
1.0 database is limited in size to available virtual memory. Important
features such as date/time/interval operations, regular expression
matching and other standard SQL features are not implemented in
Gadfly 1.0. The optimizer and the query evaluator perform optimizations
using properties of the equality predicate but do not optimize
using properties of inequalities such as BETWEEN or less-than.
It is possible to add "extension views" to a Gadfly
1.0 database, but the mechanism is somewhat clumsy and indices
over extension views are not well supported. The features of Gadfly
2.0 discussed here attempt to address these deficiencies by providing
a uniform extension model that permits addition of alternate table,
function, and predicate implementations.""")

TABLE" and the lack of outer joins and NULL values are not

associated with substitutions. A substitution is a mapping
of attribute names to values (implemented in gadfly using kjbuckets.kjDict

variable", such as NAME and a value is an assignment for that variable,
like "Dave Ascher".  In Gadfly a table is implemented as a sequence
of substitutions, and substitutions are used in many other ways as well.

Y have a join Z = (X+Y) if and only if Z.Clean() is not None.
Two substitutions that have no join are said to be inconsistent.

the value assigned to the BAR attribute and therefore have no

an abstract algebraic structure called a semilattice.""")

p("""The following thought experiment attempts to explain why the
Gadfly implementation is surprisingly fast considering that it
is almost entirely implemented in Python (an interpreted programming
language which is not especially fast when compared to alternatives).
Although Gadfly is quite complex, at an abstract level the process
of query evaluation boils down to a series of embedded loops.
Consider the following nested loops:""")

f, g, are complex, dynamic, special purpose and h is simple, general
purpose, static. Some example computations that follow this pattern
include: file massaging (perl), matrix manipulation (python, tcl),
database/cgi page generation, and vector graphics/imaging.""")

execution times10 times slower than a much harder implementation
in C, choosing arbitrary and debatable numbers assume each function
call consumes 1 tick in C, 5 ticks in java, 10 ticks in python

speeds up the calculation by half an order of magnitude compared
to the python-only implementation and brings the speed to within
a factor of 2 of an implementation done entirely in C.""")

p("""Although this artificial and contrived thought experiment is
far from conclusive, we may be tempted to draw the conclusion
that generally programmers should focus first on obtaining a working
implementation (because as John Ousterhout is reported to have
said "the biggest performance improvement is the transition
from non-working to working") using the methodology that
is most likely to obtain a working solution the quickest (Python).
Only then if the performance
is inadequate should the programmer focus on optimizing
the inner most loops, perhaps moving them to a very efficient
implementation (C). Optimizing the outer loops will buy little
improvement, and should be done later, if ever.""")

p("""This was precisely the strategy behind the gadfly implementations,
where most of the inner loops are implemented in the kjbuckets
C extension module and the higher level logic is all in Python.
This also explains why gadfly appears to be "slower"
for simple queries over small data sets, but seems to be relatively
"faster" for more complex queries over larger data sets,
since larger queries and data sets take better advantage of the
optimized inner loops.""")

p("""In private correspondence Andy Robinson points out that the
basic logical design underlying Gadfly could be adapted to provide
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and other forms of data warehousing
and data mining. Since SQL is not particularly well suited for
the kinds of requests common in these domains the higher level
interfaces would require modification, but the underlying logic
of substitutions and name mappings seems to be appropriate.""")

header("Conclusion")

p("""The revamped query engine design in Gadfly 2 supports
a flexible and general extension methodology that permits programmers
to extend the gadfly engine to include additional computations
and access to remote data sources. Among other possibilities this
will permit the gadfly engine to make use of disk based indexed
tables and to dynamically retrieve information from remote data
sources (such as an Excel spreadsheet or an Oracle database).
These features will make gadfly a very useful tool for data manipulation
and integration.""")
